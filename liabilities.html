This insurance covers damage to property, loss of stock/goods, as well as any cash or valuables kept in a locked safe. This will not only provide you with the most comprehensive cover, but will also advise you on how to prevent a burglary from happening in the first place through tailored risk assessment.As per the financial defenition Burglary Insurance is an insurance policy covering losses resulting from a burglary, which is the act of entering a building unlawfully with the intention of committing a crime, usually but not always theft. Burglary insurance for businesses is usually part of a larger policy. It ordinarily requires relatively high coinsurance, in the range of 40% to 80%.</p>

                                <p class="text-dark">Burglary and/or Housebreaking Policy covers property contained in your premises, stocks/goods owned by you or held in trust and/or commission. It also covers cash, valuables, securities kept in a locked safe or cash box in locked steel cupboard on specific request.                 The policy covers the property against loss/damage by burglary/house breaking. It also covers damage to your premises caused by burglars during burglary or attempts at burglary. The Policy pays actual loss/damage to your insured property caused by burglary/house breaking subject to the limit of Sum Insured. If Sum Insured is not adequate, Policy pays only proportionate loss. There is also a provision in the Policy to cover bulk items on ‘first loss’ basis wherein a percentage of total stock stored can be taken as that exposed to the risk of burglary and housebreaking. The premium is charged on this percentage selected only.</p>
